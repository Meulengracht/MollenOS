 *
 * The processor object is the primary object and represents a physical
 * processor. A processor contains multiple core objects, and each core object
 * represents a physical core inside a processor. Each core object can contain
 * a number of TXU (Thread eXecution Units). The usual number would be one
 * or two (HT). Each of these TXU's has the ability to schedule threads, handle
 * interrupts, send messages etc.
