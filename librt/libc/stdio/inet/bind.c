 * Standard C Support
 * - Standard Socket IO Implementation
 * 
 * When a socket is created with socket(2), it exists in a name space (address family) but has no address assigned to it. 
 * bind() assigns the address specified by addr to the socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd. addrlen specifies the 
 * size, in bytes, of the address structure pointed to by addr. Traditionally, this operation is called "assigning a name to a socket".
 * 
 * It is normally necessary to assign a local address using bind() before a SOCK_STREAM socket may receive connections (see accept(2)).
