/*
FUNCTION
	<<wcslcat>>---concatenate wide-character strings to specified length

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <wchar.h>
	size_t wcslcat(wchar_t *<[dst]>, const wchar_t *<[src]>, size_t <[siz]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <wchar.h>
	size_t wcslcat(<[dst]>, <[src]>, <[siz]>
	wchar_t *<[dst]>;
	const wchar_t *<[src]>;
	size_t <[siz]>;

DESCRIPTION
	The <<wcslcat>> function appends wide characters from <[src]> to
	end of the <[dst]> wide-character string so that the resultant
	wide-character string is not more than <[siz]> wide characters
	including the terminating null wide-character code.  A terminating
	null wide character is always added unless <[siz]> is 0.  Thus,
	the maximum number of wide characters that can be appended from
	<[src]> is <[siz]> - 1. If copying takes place between objects 
	that overlap, the behaviour is undefined.

RETURNS
	Wide-character string length of initial <[dst]> plus the
	wide-character string length of <[src]> (does not include
	terminating null wide-characters).  If the return value is
	greater than or equal to <[siz]>, then truncation occurred and
	not all wide characters from <[src]> were appended.

PORTABILITY
No supporting OS subroutines are required.
