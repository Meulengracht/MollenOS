/*
FUNCTION
	<<wcslcpy>>---copy a wide-character string to specified length

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <wchar.h>
	size_t wcslcpy(wchar_t *<[dst]>, const wchar_t *<[src]>, size_t <[siz]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <wchar.h>
	size_t wcslcpy(<[dst]>, <[src]>, <[siz]>)
	wchar_t *<[dst]>;
	const wchar_t *<[src]>;
	size_t <[siz]>;

DESCRIPTION
	<<wcslcpy>> copies wide characters from <[src]> to <[dst]>
	such that up to <[siz]> - 1 characters are copied.  A
	terminating null is appended to the result, unless <[siz]>
	is zero.

RETURNS
	<<wcslcpy>> returns the number of wide characters in <[src]>,
	not including the terminating null wide character.  If the
	return value is greater than or equal to <[siz]>, then
	not all wide characters were copied from <[src]> and truncation
	occurred.

PORTABILITY
No supporting OS subroutines are required.
